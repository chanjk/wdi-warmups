You are Ash Ketchum, and you just lost your pokedex!. How will you appease Oak now? Luckily, you are a web developer in addition to a pokemon master.

Create a rails app that will allow you to record the pokemon you capture, and store them in a postgres database.

Here are some instructions to help you get started:

1. Create a rails app called `pokedex_app`
2. Create a model called `Pokemon` (models are singular)
3. Your `Pokemons` table (table names are plural) should have the fields: `species`, `nickname`, and `level`. Pick suitable data types for these. eg: `Pikachu, Frank, 32` For a level 32 Pikachu nicknamed Frank.
4. Make two views, one for viewing current Pokemons in the pokedex, and one for recording new ones.

### Bonus:

Add some additional functionality to your pokedex. Some ideas are being able to release pokemon, or give them new nicknames, or a new view for being able to search pokemans by name/nickname or id!
